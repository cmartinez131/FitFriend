## FitFriend
**FitFriend** is an iOS app written in Swift using Swift's UIKit. FitFriend will have custom workouts tailored to the user and will help guide them through exercises. They will be able to save exercises that are important to them. My audience are people who are new to the gym or people who want to try specific workouts tailored to their persoanl fitness goals.

FitFriend will have the following features:

- [ ] User can see workout with exercises and rep ranges displayed.

The following **bonus** features are nice to have but not necessary:
